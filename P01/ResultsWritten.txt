Bubble Sort
    For 10000 data points, Random = 107257.0, Descending = 61280.0 Sorted
    random data worse than descending data, which is unusual. Generally a slow
    algorithm, average/worst cases are O(N^2).

Selection Sort
    For 10000 data points, Random = 32990.0, Descending = 33021.0
    Random/Descending times very similar. Sorts parially sorted data in similar
    time to unsorted data. Generally faster than Bubble sort but still slow,
    average/worst cases are O(N^2).

Insertion Sort
    For 10000 data points, Random = 8695.0, Descending = 15404.667 Random is
    much faster than descending, algorithm takes advantage of partially sorted
    data. Descending is very slow, slower than Selection and Bubble sorts. With
    random data it is the fastest algorithm.  Average/worst cases are O(N^2).

All tested with n=1000

Merge Sort
    Random data: 122
    Nearly Sorted: 63
    Descending: 76
    Sorted (Ascending): 108

    Good speed
    Best, avg & worst cases all O(n log N)
    Not in-place
    Stable

Quick Sort (Left-most pivot)
    Random data: 2291
    Nearly sorted: 221
    Descending: 4000
    Sorted (Ascending): 3810

    Relatively slow
    Held back by bad pivot selection, usually not evenly splitting sub-array,
        especially with already sorted data.
    Quick sort, so is O(N log N) but could degrade to O(N^2)
    In place
    Unstable

Quick Sort (Median of 3 pivot)
    Random data: 1245
    Nearly sorted: 44
    Descending: 1039
    Sorted (Ascending): 5763

    Faster than left-most pivot
    Quick sort, so is O(N log N) but could degrade to O(N^2)
    In place
    Unstable

3-Way Quicksort
    Unimplemented

    Better with data with many duplicates

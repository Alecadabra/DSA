Syllabus:

> Introduction to fundamental data structures, algorithms and techniques in computing. Basic structures include stacks, queues and linked lists. Advanced structures explored are trees, hash tables and heaps. Algorithms discussed include sorting and recursion. Complexity analysis of these areas is also examined.

There's no proper commit history because it wasn't developed using GitHub.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A social network simulator. Simulates users that make posts, with other users having a given chance to like each post made by the people they follow, which propogates the post to their followers. Users that like a post also have a given chance to follow the original poster. Implemented using a graph data structure to represent the network along with many others.

Weekly asessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
